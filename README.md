**About Me**
---


My name is Aajit Singh Rathore, and I’m a student with a strong passion for robotics, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. I enjoy working on both open-source and closed-source projects, constantly seeking ways to innovate through technology. Currently, I’m developing **Project NASVI: Smart Navigation Assistance System for the Visually Impaired**. Inspired by observing the daily challenges faced by blind individuals, this project aims to make a meaningful impact on their mobility and independence.
